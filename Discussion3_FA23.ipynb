    "## What is web scraping?\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is the process of creating structured data frames readable by computers from less-structured web pages that are intended to be read by humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Do you need to scrape?\n",
    "\n",
    "Scraping is difficult, error-prone, and may get you in legal or ethical trouble. Always check if the information you are seeking already exists in a nicer format. Many companies also have APIs or other infrastructure dedicated to serving automated requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethics of scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "Scraping is the aspect of data science most likely to get you into trouble. Legally, there are two main concerns: copyright violation if you are making copies of content that is protected by copyright, and terms-of-service violation. Many sites will also attempt to block scrapers. Acting to avoid these blocks may constitute hacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to legal problems, there are ethical problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Respect other people's hard work. Collecting information for a cool website is difficult and takes a long time and careful preparation. Is it fair to take all that work and use it for your purposes?\n",
    "* Respect other people's businesses. People feed their families by collecting and sharing information, for example through ad revenue. They may be unhappy if they think you are trying to steal their work and prevent them from monetizing it. Websites also sometimes pay for bandwidth and cloud services, and you don't want to take up all their resources for purposes that provide no revenue.\n",
    "* Respect other people's audiences. Don't [DDOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) a website! Keep requests spaced to about 2/second at most. Web hits don't take a lot of resources, but it's easy to flood a site with requests, locking others out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Find a page that contains the info you want. Some older pages are static, but most of what you will see today are views of databases. For example, Amazon has a database of products, Letterboxd has a database of movies, and Netflix has a database of shows. Each page either lists entities in the database or gives information about specific entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would prefer to get access directly to the database, and in some cases you can. But for whatever reason sometimes the web page is all you can get. This process can be difficult because web pages are optimized for people to look at, not for computers to operate on. But it is simpler because in this case a computer has to generate a page *from* a database record and a web browser has to know how to display the elements on the page so that humans can read them. These constraints mean that there are regularities in how specific pieces of information are shown in  HTML, and if you can figure them out, you can reverse the page generation process and get back to something that looks more like a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you know which pages to get? Often an index or search result page leads to individual pages with more detailed information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web scraping in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library allows you to download files from the web. It is much easier to use than `urllib`. You can use the `requests` library to get information from web pages so that you can save them to files or analyze their data in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "After using `requests` to access web data, you'll use [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to parse that information, organized in HTML. `BeautifulSoup` makes querying a tree of tags and their attributes much easier than trying to parse HTML from scratch. You'll need to spend some time looking at the target web page and finding the combination of tag names and classes you're interested in, but `BeautifulSoup` can help access that information once you know what you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "As usual, to use these new modules you'll need to first **install `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` to your virtual environment for this class**. Only once you've completed that process can successfully you run the next cell of code to load in `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and other modules.\n",
